# **Zahnen's Bakery**
### A console application using C#, December 11, 2020

#### By Zahnen Garner

---  

_This console application was created as my independent project for my eighth week at Epicodus. The application allows users to order bread and pastries from Zahnen's Bakery and receive an order confirmation with totals. The application was created to apply concepts I learned this week which include the basics of writing console applications in C#, creating custom classes and methods in C#, and testing C# apps in MSTest, ._

## Setup/Installation Instructions

### To run the project locally:

* _Open your git-capable command line program (we recommend Terminal on Mac or Git Bash on PC)_

* _Once cloned, use the "$ cd " command to navigate to the directory created in the previous step._
* _You must have .NET Core V2.2 installed in order to run the console app successfully. If you do not have .NET Core V2.2 installed, find more information and download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)_
* _Once in the newly cloned directory, enable testing by running "dotnet restore" within both directories found at the root level of the project directory (Bakery and Bakery.Tests)._
* _To test specs outlined in the Specs section, navigate to the Bakery.Tests directory in your command line and run "dotnet test"_
